Software Development Laboratory 2 Midterm Project

Most of the assets are from the Asset Store and free assets. So the game may not be very good in terms of UI. My second major game with Unity. The first was the card guessing game. [Unity vocabulary game project link](https://github.com/MyscherzoTR/Unity-vocabulary-game-project) This project was developed for internship 2 and will continue to be developed.

## Main Menu
There are 2 buttons and 2 textbox in the Main Menu. 
1. Giriş Yap (login) and Kayıt ol (register) button
2. Mail and Password text box

# Main Menu Login
You can choose and play previously played levels from this section. I used PlayerPrefs for this. Buttons become active or inactive according to PlayerPrefs.

## Main Menu Edit Profile
Sample designs for a level(Level 3). As I said, assets are free and i got them from asset store.

# Main Menu Add Question
The climb button is normally deactivated. It becomes active when it comes to the relevant ladder. When the climb button is active, I deactivate the attack and jump buttons to avoid problems such as bugs.

# Sample Level Game Over Screen
When the character we manage dies (by the enemy or falls down), the endgame panel becomes active.

1. Main Menu; returns to the main menu.
2. RePlay; restarts the active episode (scene).
